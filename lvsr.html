    <h2>Legend Vs. Reality:</h2>
    <hgroup>
        <h3>Legend: Vampires ruthlessly drink the blood of unexpected victims</h3>
        <h3>Reality: Modern Vampires Only Drink Blood From The Willing</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>The vast majority of modern-day vampires are peaceful people who feel that drinking small amounts of blood from willing participants called "donors" helps sustain their energy and health. Some others eschew blood completely, and simply draw the psychic energy of others through touch. Even vampires who do drink blood — who refer to themselves as "sanguinarians" — don't subsist primarily on blood, though; they eat pasta and hoagies and jalapeno poppers, just like you.</p>
    <h2>Legend Vs. Reality:</h2>
    <hgroup>
        <h3>Legend: Vampires suck blood from the neck</h3>
        <h3>Reality: Not usually, because it’s very painful and highly unsanitary.</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>>First of all, there’s no biting – that’s neither safe nor sanitary – and with too many vital arteries, the neck isn’t the favored spot. Real vampires perform the blood-letting ritual only with willing donors—friends, family members, significant others, or members of donor networks—and usually only after both the vampire and the donor have their blood tested. Some vampires use sterile single-use thermoplastic medical tubing to extrude blood into small receptacles for drinking on the spot, or for later storage; others may use sterile blades to make small incisions on the donor, and drink directly from the wound before cleaning and bandaging it. Still, feeding is a sensual and sacred ritual.</p>
    <p> Transactions aren’t carnages leaving the victim lifeless behind in a dark alley, and nor do vampires sleep in coffins or burn in daylight. They’re generally cool with garlic. Most of them don’t even have fangs.</p>

        <h3>Legend: Vampires are undead</h3>
        <h3>Reality: Real vampires are not undead creatures nor are they monsters.</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>This myth most likely comes from the Dracula stories that are only barely based on the real Romanian hero Vlad, and or from the medical condition known as Catalepsy.</p>
    <p>Story goes Vlads death, happened at a fairly young age due to his own brother betraying him, resulting in his brother helping kill Vlad by encasing him in a casket and letting him die buried alive. After the clergy that used Vlad's brother as a pawn to make this happen knew that Vlad was dead, they made it quite clear to his brother what he had just done. The claim of vampires being undead branches from Vlad bones apparently not existing inside of the casket that he was buried alive in. Truth is the bones would not be in there because his brother after learning the truth would have dug him up, then given him a new casket and a proper burial to honor his brother Vlad.</p>

      <h3>Legend: Real vampires sleep in coffins / caskets</h3>
      <h3>Reality: Untrue for the most part</h3>
    </hgroup>
    <p>The vampire community is incredibly diverse. Although some vampires choose to follow the asthetic lifestyle of a vampire, which includes things like sleeping in a coffin, it is neither universal among them nor a rule for the community.</p>
    <hgroup>
        <h3>Legend: One becomes a vampire by having their blood drank</h3>
        <h3>Reality: most vampires believe they're born that way</h3>
    </hgroup>

    <p>Their self-described nature begins to manifest around or just after puberty. It derives, according to them, from the lack of subtle energies their bodies produce – energies other people take for granted. That’s the general consensus anyway. It’s a condition they claim to be unable to change. So, they embrace it.</p>
