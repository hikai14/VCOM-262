      <h2>History Of the Vampire Community</h2>


      <p>In the early 1970s, some of the first organizations dedicated to studying vampires were also taking shape. Jeanne Keyes Youngson founded the Count Dracula Fan Club (now The Vampire Empire) in 1965, originally as an organization dedicated to Dracula and vampire fiction and film. But between 1970 and 1972, Youngson began receiving letters from people who self-identified as vampires. By 1974, after meeting with some of her vampire-fans, she extended the group’s purview to include real vampirism, demonstrating some of the first intellectual interest in the topic.</p>
      <p>By the 1980s, ethnographers began to identify sub-sections of the vampire community, including people who experience sexual gratification through blood-letting rituals. The community grew in the 1990s, but real vampires still existed mostly in isolation or in small groups, relying on nearby fan conventions, low-circulation newsletters, and print correspondence.</p>
      <p>Then, all at once, a confluence of cultural trends facilitated the rapid growth of the real-vampire community.</p>
      <p>The first was the rise of Anne Rice conventions. Rice had begun writing her gothic fiction in the 1970s, but the 1994 film adaptation of her book Interview with the Vampire ushered in a new era of mainstream interest in vampires.</p>
      <p>ut through its growth, at least one thing has stayed the same for the real vampires community: the stigma. Even in an era that has embraced previously fringe identities at face value, a taste for human blood remains a difficult practice to accept, especially because almost no one has found any real basis for the condition. But in fact, vampires are a proud, living critique of normalcy—which is, perhaps, the thing about them that frightens people the most.</p>
